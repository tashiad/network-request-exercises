# Network Request Exercises

* This was a small holiday break project to get introduced to network requests: specifically GET, POST, and DELETE.
* I familiarized myself with Postman for testing out my requests and seeing what data I got back with each endpoint.
* I built out a simple frontend to display some sample data and  experimented with adding and removing the data with POST and DELETE

## How to Run
* Run `npm start` in terminal
* Open `index.js`
* Experiment with adding new animals through the form and then  deleting them

## Wins
* Learned the basics for using APIs!
* Learned how to run a server
* Learned how to use Postman

## Challenges
Server was finicky at times. New animals would be added just fine sometimes and then not added a few minutes later, despite the server still running and no changes being made to the code. Since no errors were showing up in the console, I determined that this is likely a server connection issue and not so much an issue with the code itself.

## Future Improvements
Make the design prettier!
